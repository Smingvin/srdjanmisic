  <h1 id="good-luck-finding-a-copywriter-in-these-dark-times">Good luck finding a copywriter in these dark times</h1>
<p><em>It’s chaos out there — mobs of hungry freelancers are waving and yelling at you, trying to get hired. But actually finding a competent copywriter among them? It’s like searching for a decent surgeon among butchers and barbers.</em></p>
<p>IMAGINE IF A LOVED ONE HAD TO BE CUT OPEN, and you had no other choice but to send for the guy who trimmed your sideburns the day before.</p>
<p>If the barber was busy, you’d send for the grinning butcher with the bloody apron.</p>
<p>You’d just hope they’d show up with a steady hand. Either way it would be hit or miss.</p>
<p>That’s how it was with surgeons until about the 19 century, and that’s how it is with copywriters today.</p>
<p>From charlatans to masters, anyone can call themselves copywriters regardless of skill or experience.</p>
<p>The barbers among them might generate a few sales before they sweep out the remains of your butchered brand like so much trimmed hair and soiled bandages.</p>
<p>The best will handle your business with care, wielding the pen with the delicate precision of a modern surgeon.</p>
<p>How do you know which is which when looking for a copywriter for your business?</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<h2 id="a-fellow-copywriter-of-higher-stature--or-even-better-an-industry-legend--went-on-record-saying-he-was-impressed-with-the-writers-copy">A fellow copywriter of higher stature – or even better, an industry legend – went on record saying he was impressed with the writer’s copy</h2>
<p>Barber-surgeons operated in dim backrooms, muffling their patients’ screams with bandages. Modern-day surgeons ply their trade openly in well-lit operating theaters as spectators observe them through a looking glass.</p>
<p>Likewise, copywriters who know their stuff work in the open. And they seek out feedback from peers at the pinnacle of their profession.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be reassuring to hear an A-list copywriter talk approvingly about your copywriter’s work?</p>
<p>For example, here’s how Amazon best-selling author Kevin Rogers, student of Gary Halbert’s protege John Carlton and his panel of hotshot writers critiqued a Facebook ad written by your candidate copywriter: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/rogers.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="i-love-the-way-you-phrased-these-things-in-ways-i-havent-heard-before-but-i-knew-exactly-what-you-meantthis-is-gold----im-impressed-with-the-copy">“I love the way you phrased these things in ways I haven’t heard before but I knew exactly what you meant.This is gold . . . I’m impressed with the copy”</h3>
<p>– Kevin Rogers,<br>
Author of 60-second Sales Hook and founder of Copy Chief</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/mazza.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="i-love-it-such-good-copy-as-soon-as-people-get-into-it-theyre-gonna-be-hooked">I love it… such good copy, as soon as people get into it, they’re gonna be hooked.</h3>
<p>— Rachel Mazza,<br>
DR copywriter and host of The Business of Writing podcast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peer approval is good to have, but keep looking. You need harder evidence, such as…</p>
<h2 id="the-copywriters-campaigns-have-delivered--even-without-the-crutch-of-an-established-brand-name">The copywriter&rsquo;s campaigns have delivered — even without the crutch of an established brand name</h2>
<p>Overcoming the resistance of skepticism, lethargy, and price to make a sale from scratch is like extracting a firmly rooted tooth.</p>
<p>It would be reassuring to know that your candidate copywriter experienced this entire process without anyone working the tooth loose beforehand.</p>
<p>So look for copywriters who at least once started at zero. You want a copywriter who started with a client no one ever heard of, an empty mailing list, and a household advertising budget&hellip;and devised a campaign that raised just short of $300k.</p>
<p>Such a result was surely a big win for the discerning client who chose to work with such a copywriter.
But then again, maybe the success was achieved despite the copy. There&rsquo;s one way to know.</p>
<h2 id="the-copywriter-uses-words-like-smelling-salts">The copywriter uses words like smelling salts</h2>
<p>Most people go through life half-sedated. Good copy ought to jolt readers back into wide-eyed consciousness like they sniffed a smelling salt.</p>
<p>You can tell the copy worked when readers react to like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/jim.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="images/phil.png" alt="">
<img src="images/joe.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All that said, you also need to make sure that&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-writer-doesnt-degrade-your-brand-like-a-snake-oil-salesman">The writer doesn’t degrade your brand like a snake-oil salesman</h2>
<p>A competent copywriter is a partner who simplifies, sharpens and enhances your message, magnifying the impact your business has on people’s lives.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, the copywriter relies on an arsenal of persuasion techniques, using them as sharp operating instruments.</p>
<p>Good copywriters should know that some of these instruments should never be taken out of the case. The ones that make the copy drip with sleaze.</p>
<p>And the best are honest about the murky origins of the craft.</p>
<p>The pioneer of the profession, every copywriter’s great-grandfather, s Claude Hopkins. He picked up his persuasion techniques from patent medicine sellers of the 1890s &ndash; literal snake-oil salesmen.</p>
<p>Hopkins cleaned up and refined these techniques and applied them to convince Americans to brush their teeth and drink orange juice. But more than a hundred years later you can still follow the trail of rotten apples in the copywriting profession.</p>
<p>Yet, just as modern surgery overcame its dark origins of operating on screaming patients in dim and dirty backrooms, so should your copywriter candidate be a class act, protecting your brand&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<h2 id="the-copywriter-is-available">The copywriter is available</h2>
<p>The final criterion to look for in your candidate is that he’s actually available for work. Even an A-lister is of little worth to you if he or she is scheduled for years in advance.</p>
<p>But if you’re reading this perhaps you got a lucky break.</p>
