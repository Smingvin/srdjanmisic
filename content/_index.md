Imagine if a loved one had to be cut open, and you had no other choice but send for the guy who trimmed your sideburns the day before. If the barber was busy, you’d send for the grinning butcher with the bloody apron. 

Awful risk either way, but that's just how it was if you needed a surgeon in the middle ages. It's also pretty much how it is if you need to hire a copywriter today.

Anyone, regardless of skill or experience, can call themself a copywriter. Finding a competent one among them is like searching for a decent surgeon among butchers and barbers.

Choose poorly, and your writer may generate a few sales before sweeping out the remains of your butchered brand like so much trimmed hair and soiled bandages.

Choose wisely, and your writer will help inspire a loyal following of customers who know, like, and trust you.

So how can you tell which is which?

Here's how.

## 1) Copywriter has some sort of peer approval

Barber-surgeons operated in dim backrooms, muffling their patients’ screams with bandages. Modern-day surgeons ply their trade openly in well-lit operating theaters. Spectators observe them through a looking glass.

Likewise, copywriters who know their stuff work in the open. They seek out feedback from peers at the pinnacle of their profession -- the A-listers.

For example, here’s how Amazon best-selling author Kevin Rogers (student of Gary Halbert’s protege John Carlton) and his panel of hotshot writers critiqued a Facebook ad written by your candidate copywriter:

>
> I love the way you phrased these things in ways I haven’t heard before but I knew exactly what you meant. This is gold . . . I’m impressed with the copy.
>
>  – Kevin Rogers,  
> Author of 60-second Sales Hook and founder of Copy Chief

>
> I love it… such good copy, as soon as people get into it, they’re gonna be hooked.
>
> — Rachel Mazza,  
> DR copywriter and host of The Business of Writing podcast

Once you are reassured with peer approval, look for harder evidence.

## 2) The copywriter's campaigns have delivered — even without the crutch of an established brand name

Overcoming the resistance of skepticism, lethargy, and price to make a sale from scratch is like extracting a firmly rooted tooth. 

It would be reassuring to know that your candidate copywriter experienced this entire process without anyone working the tooth loose beforehand. 

So look for copywriters who at least once started at zero. You want a copywriter who started with a client no one ever heard of, an empty mailing list, and a household advertising budget...and devised a campaign that raised just short of $300k.
{{<sidenote>}} It was a Kickstarter project called [Forest of Radgost](https://www.kickstarter.com). {{< /sidenote >}} 

Such a result was surely a big win for the discerning client who chose to work with such a copywriter.

But then again, maybe the success was achieved despite the copy. There's one way to know.

## 3) The copywriter uses words like smelling salts

Most people go through life half-sedated. Good copy ought to jolt readers back into wide-eyed consciousness like they sniffed a smelling salt.

You can tell the copy worked when readers react to like this:

All that said, you also need to make sure that...

## 4) The writer doesn’t degrade your brand like a snake-oil salesman

A competent copywriter is a partner who simplifies, sharpens and enhances your message, magnifying the impact your business has on people’s lives.

To accomplish that, the copywriter relies on an arsenal of persuasion techniques, using them as sharp operating instruments.

Good copywriters should know that some of these instruments should never be taken out of the case. The ones that make the copy drip with sleaze.

And the best are honest about the murky origins of the craft.

The pioneer of the profession, every copywriter’s great-grandfather, s Claude Hopkins. He picked up his persuasion techniques from patent medicine sellers of the 1890s -- literal snake-oil salesmen.

Hopkins cleaned up and refined these techniques and applied them to convince Americans to brush their teeth and drink orange juice. But more than a hundred years later you can still follow the trail of rotten apples in the copywriting profession.

Yet, just as modern surgery overcame its dark origins of operating on screaming patients in dim and dirty backrooms, so should your copywriter candidate be a class act, protecting your brand's reputation.

## 5) The copywriter is available

The final criterion to look for in your candidate is that he’s actually available for work. Even an A-lister is of little worth to you if he or she is scheduled for years in advance.

But if you’re reading this perhaps you got a lucky break.
